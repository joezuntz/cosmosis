explanation: >
    The emcee sampler is a form of Monte-Carlo Markov Chain that uses
    an ensemble of 'walkers' that explore the parameter space. 
    Each walker chooses another walker at random and proposes along the
    line connecting the two of them using the Metropolis acceptance rule.
    The proposal scale is given by the separation of the two walkers.

    It is parallel, so multiple processes can be used to speed up the 
    running. It is also affine invariant, so that no covariance matrix or other 
    tuning is required for the proposal.

    The burn-in behavior of emcee can sometimes be poor; it is much better
    to start the chain as near to the maximum posterior as possible.  The 
    maxlike or similar samplers can help you find this.

    The total number of samples taken is walkers*samples.
    

installation: >
    emcee is included in the cosmosis bootstrap, but if you are installing
    manually you can get emcee using the command:

    pip install emcee  #to install centrally, may require sudo
    
    pip install emcee --user #to install just for you
    

# List of configuration options for this sampler
params:
    walkers: (integer) number of walkers in the space
    samples: (integer) number of jumps to attempt per walker
    nsteps: (integer) number of sample steps taken in between writing output
    random_start: (bool; default=N) whether to start the walkers at random points in the prior instead of near the start.  Usually a bad idea
    start_points: (string; default='') a file containing starting points for the walkers. If not specified walkers are initialized randomly from the prior distribution.
