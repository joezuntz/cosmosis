explanation: >
    Zeus is a pure-Python implementation of the Ensemble Slice Sampling method. 
    It can be used to sample from multimodal and highly correlated distributions 
    that are difficult for traditional MCMC methods.

    Zeus uses an ensemble of walkers that explore the parameter space using slice 
    sampling, which automatically adapts to the local structure of the distribution. 
    This makes it particularly effective for complex posterior distributions.

    The total number of samples generated will be walkers * samples.

installation: >
    Zeus needs to be installed separately:

    pip install zeus-mcmc  # to install centrally, may require sudo
    
    pip install zeus-mcmc --user  # to install just for you
