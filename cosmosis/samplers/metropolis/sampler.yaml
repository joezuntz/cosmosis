    "Metropolis-Hastings is the classic Monte-Carlo Markov Chain method
    for sampling from distributions.

    MH as a Markov process where from each point in chain there is a 
    process for choosing the next point in such a way that the distribution of
    chain points tends to the underlying distribution.

    In MH a proposal function is defined that suggests a possible next point
    in the chain.  The posterior of that point is evaluated and if:
    P_new / P_ol > U[0,1]
    where U[0,1] is a random number from 0-1, then the new point is 'accepted'
    and becomes the next chain element.  Otherwise the current point is repeated.

    The choice of proposal function strongly determines how quickly the sampler
    converges to the underlying distribution.  In particular a covariance matrix
    approximately describing the distribution provides a significant speed up.

    The CosmoSIS metropolis sampler tries to mirror the
    CosmoMC MH implementation (though we do not yet have the fast-slow split).

    Metropolis-Hastings is intrinsically a serial (non-parallel) algorithm. Like
    CosmoMC, CosmoSIS parallelizes it by running several independent chains in parallel
    and comparing them to assess convergence using the Gelman-Rubin test.
