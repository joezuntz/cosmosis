explanation: >
    Nested sampling is a method designed to calculate the Bayesian Evidence
    of a distribution, for use in comparing multiple models to see which fit
    the data better.

    The evidence is the integral of the likelihood over the prior; it is
    equivalent to the probability of the model given the data (marginalizing over
    the specific parameter values):
    B = P(D|M) = \int P(D|Mp) P(p|M) dp

    Nested sampling is an efficient method for evaluating this integral using
    members of an ensemble of live points and steadily replacing the lowest likelihood point with a new one 
    from a gradually shrinking proposal so and evaluating the integral in horizontal
    slices.

    Multinest is a particularly sophisticated implementation of this which can cope 
    with multi-modal distributions using a k-means clustering algorithm and a proposal
    made from a collection of ellipsoids.

    The output from multinest is not a set of posterior samples, but rather a set
    of weighted samples - when making histograms or parameter estimates these must
    be included.

    The primary mulitnest parameter is the number of live points in the ensemble.
    If this number is too small you will get too few posterior samples in the result,
    and if it is too large the sampling will take a long time.  A few hundred seems
    to be reasonable for typical cosmology problems.

    One odd feature of the multinest output is that it doesn't save any results until it has
    done a complete run through the parameter space.  It then starts again on a second run, 
    and sometimes a third depending on the parameters.  So don't worry if you don't see any
    lines in the output file for a while.
