Download CosmoSIS modules from internet repositories.

It is a very, very good idea to store your work in a version controlled repository.

CosmoSIS strongly encourages you to do this, and you can use the GitHub or BitBucket
websites to do it for free (to keep your work private before you're ready to release
it you may need to register as an academic/non-commercial user if you don't want to pay).

This script helps you download an existing module that you or someone else has put
in a repository.  If you want instead to make a new module and repository, then use the 
cosmosis-new-module tool instead.

To use this script you'll need to know the web address of the module you want to download,
for example, http://github.com/my_friends_user_name/my_friends_module
