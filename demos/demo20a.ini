; This file is identical to demo5.ini except that we have taken out all
; references to the riess11 likelihood, which tightened the parameter

; The emcee sampler, which uses the Goodman & Weare algorithm.
sampler = emcee

[emcee]
; The emcee sampler uses the concept of walkers, a collection of live points.
; Sampling is done along lines that connect pairs of walkers.  The number of
; walkers must be at least 2*nparam + 1, but in general more than that usually
; works better.
walkers = 64
; This many samples is overkill, just to make the plots look a lot nicer.
samples = 400
; This is the interval at which convergence diagnostics are performed.
